# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

My LazyVim based configuration for nvim.

Main features:
- cmp suggestions are delayed for less distraction
- cmp suggestions are not inserted on ENTER; need to be specifically selected
- laravel blade template support (not perfect, but better than nothing)

Kinda optimized for Laravel development with Vue.js and TailwindCSS.

Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) for more details on lazyvim.
